# Claude Manager

Manage multiple sessions of Claude Code more easily

I missed the agent workflow in cursor when I moved to CC exclusively so made this to replace it

## Run locally

Run this in the directory you're working in

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Claude Code CLI installed (`claude` command available)

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
